## Summary
 This webpage is created to test your JavaScript knowledge!  Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I have created a timed quiz.  You have only 1 minute to complete the entire quiz, you will lose time for wrong questions and will receive your score at the end.  You are able to save you score and initials so you can try again and get a better score.  

This was a difficult challenge and took many hours, although not complete, it does indicate my outline for completion and will eventually meet the critera.

The following image demonstrates the functionality and appearance on one screen:  ![Coding Quiz](.assets/images/QuizScreenshot.png)

## Lessons Learned

Through this project I learned how to use online resources, my peers, and MDN to further my knowlege of Javascript.
